# Desmond AI Chat ðŸ¤–

> A special AI chat application built with love for a curious 6-year-old who loves learning and asking questions.

## The Story Behind Desmond

This project was created for Desmond, a bright and curious 6-year-old who uses ChatGPT every day to learn new things and explore the world. He asks questions about everything - from dinosaurs to space, from math problems to how things work. Sometimes he gets frustrated when AI gives him incorrect answers, so his dad built him his own personal AI assistant that he can trust and customize.

When Desmond woke up one morning, he asked his dad to create a ChatGPT-like app just for him - and that's how **Desmond AI** was born!
